    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Dubbed The Queen of Breakfast, this dish is a beautiful gem amongst the rubble of other egg dishes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Cooked to perfection by the tried-and-true classic recipe, Erina added a secret weapon to it: Karasumi powder to further enhance the egg theme. One bite will instinctively cause servility to Erina.
